# System Architecture and Design

This document explains the architecture and design decisions behind the Agentic Problem Solver.

## Overview

The Agentic Problem Solver is designed as a modular system that uses language models to break down, solve, and verify programming tasks. The system follows a step-by-step approach to ensure reliable and maintainable code generation.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System

The agent system is built around the concept of a workflow with distinct steps:

1. **Understanding**: Analyzes and breaks down task requirements
2. **Planning**: Creates a structured plan for implementation
3. **Execution**: Generates the actual code solution
4. **Verification**: Tests and validates the solution

This step-based approach ensures:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable behavior
- Easy debugging and monitoring
- Ability to retry specific steps

### 2. LLM Provider System

The LLM (Language Learning Model) provider system is designed for flexibility and reliability:

- **Factory Pattern**: Uses a factory to create and manage providers
- **Abstract Base Class**: Defines a common interface for all providers
- **Configuration System**: Supports easy switching between providers
- **Error Handling**: Includes retry logic and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Message System

Messages are the primary data structure for communication:

- **Typed Messages**: Different types for different purposes (Human, AI, System)
- **Metadata Support**: Carries additional context and state information
- **Immutable Design**: Prevents accidental state modifications

### 4. State Management

State is managed at multiple levels:

1. **Agent State**:

   - Current step
   - Message history
   - Error state
   - Results

2. **Graph State**:
   - Message flow
   - Step transitions
   - Context information

## Design Decisions

### 1. Async First

The system is built with async/await from the ground up:

- Enables efficient handling of I/O operations
- Supports streaming responses
- Allows for future scalability
- Maintains responsiveness

### 2. Type Safety

Strong typing is used throughout:

- TypedDict for structured data
- Enums for state management
- Optional types for nullable values
- Type hints for better IDE support

### 3. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling strategy:

- Early validation
- Graceful degradation
- Clear error messages
- State recovery mechanisms

### 4. Modularity

The system is built with modular components:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual components
- Simple to extend or modify
- Pluggable architecture

### 5. Configuration

Flexible configuration system:

- Environment variables for deployment
- Runtime configuration for dynamic changes
- Defaults for easy startup
- Per-instance customization

## Data Flow

1. User Input → CLI
2. CLI → Agent
3. Agent → LLM Provider
4. LLM Provider → Response
5. Agent → State Update
6. Agent → Output

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:

   - Individual component testing
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**:

   - Component interaction testing
   - Real LLM provider testing
   - End-to-end workflows

3. **Property Tests**:
   - State transition validation
   - Data structure invariants
   - Error handling verification

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**:

   - Multiple concurrent agents
   - Distributed processing
   - Load balancing

2. **Extensibility**:

   - New LLM providers
   - Custom steps
   - Plugin system

3. **Monitoring**:

   - Performance metrics
   - Usage statistics
   - Error tracking

4. **Security**:
   - Input validation
   - Code execution sandboxing
   - API key management

## Dependencies

Key external dependencies:

- langchain: Agent and LLM framework
- google-generativeai: Gemini API
- pytest: Testing framework
- python-dotenv: Configuration management

## Best Practices

1. **Code Generation**:

   - Always validate generated code
   - Include error handling
   - Follow language conventions
   - Add appropriate comments

2. **State Management**:

   - Clear state between runs
   - Validate state transitions
   - Handle edge cases
   - Maintain immutability

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Include recovery steps
   - Log relevant information
   - Maintain system stability
